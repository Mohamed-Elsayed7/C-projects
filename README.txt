h1 -> In smart phones, DECT phone or SIM cards contacts can be stored. As a simplified version of such a storage in this task an array of contacts sorted alphabetically by name shall be programmed.

h2 -> A regular continued fraction for any real valued number x is defined by the formula above and can be written in a short form with squared brackets x=[f0;f1,f2,f3,…]. 
Each rational number is uniquely represented by a finite regular continued fraction, each irrational number by an infinite one.
Task is to represent this short form for continued fractions inside a computer by lists of integer numbers, to 	input, calculate and also delete them; no global variables shall be defined and used.

h3 -> The World Health Organization (WHO)) standardises with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) an internationally used classification system of human diseases. Task will be to write a C++ program reading a file with the ICD codes (version 2018) and  building up a list in main memory with all ICD codes and diagnoses read (all other data within this file shall be ignored), that users can search for an ICD code or for a diagnosis (compare online searches like http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/icdonlineversions/en/ or http://www.icd-code.de/.)

h4 -> German railways plans to re-implement the software showing departures in an object-oriented programming style. In H4 classes (see UML model above) and an example for a simplified prototype shall be implemented.

h5 -> For a TravelAgency a simplified management of enquiries of Trips shall get programmed including a Hotel and the Transport for the outward journey and the journey back by Flight or Train or SelfOrganised.
